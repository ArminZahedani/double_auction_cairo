# Double Auction - Cairo
A small double auction PoC that serves as a playground to better learn Cairo.

## Why?
I already know Periodic Double Auctions from my master thesis and using smart contracts was actually an initial idea. I also wanted to learn Cairo and after reading the Cairo101 book, it was time to try it out on a non-fibonacci/non-hello world example.
